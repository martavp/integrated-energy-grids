# Integrated Energy Grids

This repository includes relevant tutorials and solutions to problems proposed in the MSc course [Integrated Energy Grids](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2024-2025/46770?menulanguage=en) at DTU.. 

If you detect any error, please [open an issue](https://github.com/martavp/integrated-energy-grids/issues) and we will try to fix it. Ideally, you can also pull request the fix.

## Usage

You can go to a nice visualization of the problems [here](https://martavp.github.io/integrated-energy-grids/intro.html) (or following the web address displayed on the top right corner of this repository).

There you will find instructions on how to install Python, learn the packages used to solve the problems and read the solutions in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

If you don't want to install anything on your computer, you will also find instructions on how to use [Google colab](https://colab.google/) to run the scripts online.
