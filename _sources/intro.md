# Welcome

Welcome to the website accompanying the course [Integrated Energy Grids course](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2024-2025/46770?menulanguage=en). This course has been developed by [Assoc. Prof. Marta Victoria](https://martavictoria.org) and offered at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/). 

On this website, you will find tutorials for different topics covered in the course, as well as detailed solutions for some of the problems proposed in the course. Python and packages such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `networkx`, and `pypsa` are used to obtain the solution. The facilitate the starting process, practical introductions to those packages are also provided. 

The topics covered in the problems include:

- Time series analysis applied to wind and solar generation
- Optimization problems and interpretation of KKT/Lagrange multipliers
- Optimal economic dispatch
- Incidence matrix representing a network topology and susceptance matrix
- Optimal power flow and linearized optimal power flow
- Gas networks
- Heat networks
- Capacity and dispatch optimization in a single node and a network
- Multi-carrier energy systems integration
